# Welcome to Polyblocks!

This UI library is opinionated, components are styled according to our design system guidelines and specifications to make precise implementation the default. However, there are ways to override them.

We followed the [component-driven UI](https://www.componentdriven.org/#how) process:

> The development and design practice of building user interfaces with modular components. UIs are built from the “bottom up” starting with basic components then progressively combined to assemble screens.

Clone repo and run Storybook locally via `npm start`. Browse components (Polyblocks) by navigating to them in the sidebar. View their code and play around with controls to learn how they work.
